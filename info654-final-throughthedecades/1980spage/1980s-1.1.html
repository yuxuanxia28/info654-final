 <h4 class="description">The AIDS Epidemic has killed 700,000 people as of 2018, 
                a plague that disproportionately effected the queer community. The Reagan 
                administration either ignored or openly mocked the thousands 
                of people who were dying. This image shows the original San Francisco Gay Men's 
                Chorus's surviving members in white coats. Their friends, lovers, and 
                choirmates who died are represented by the people wearing black. </h4>

 <h4 class="description">ACT UP was a grassroots organization created in 
    response to government inaction to address the ongoing crisis. 
    They were instrumental in forcing the public to pay attention, stop the

 <h4 class="description">The Berlin Wall that separated East and West Germany 
    and had long been a literal and symbolic division between the West and the

 <h4 class="description">When Reagan brutally crushed the PATCO strike, forcing workers
     into unsafe working conditions, it marked a massive shift away from union power and
      organizing that would have ripple effects into the state and conditions of labor for decades.</h4>
