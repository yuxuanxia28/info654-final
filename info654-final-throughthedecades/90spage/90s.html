                blockbuster murder trial, on June 15, 1995, O.J. Simpson struggled to fit his
                hand into a glove prosecutors claimed he wore the night his ex-wife Nicole Brown
                Simpson and Ronald Goldman were killed. The request to have Simpson try on gloves
                in court became a pivotal moment in a trial that ended in acquittal.
